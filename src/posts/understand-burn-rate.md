## Cost of Living per month

This is where the sum of your monthly expenses shows up. It is being calculated based on everything that you mentioned in the form on the left in the expenses section.

## Cost of Living per day

Represents exactly what it says – the daily cost of living. Calculated based upon the expenses / 30.

## Cost of Living per hour

It’s easier to achieve a seemingly smaller goal than a bigger one. In this case, you can compare your current cost of living (daily) and think of how you can tweak it.
Think of entrepreneurs. When planning, strategizing, and budgeting, they often shift scales from “macro” to “micro”. We could say that we need $5,000 in monthly revenue to be profitable. Which is $7 every hour. The latter seems to be a more achievable goal.

## Cash Remaining

In other words, savings. This is the amount of money left from the income - expenses. It’s great to know about it. But it’s more useful to think of ways to leverage it in the first place. That is, money can work and now you have a chance to explore the opportunities.

## Time Surplus

If you provided the number of hours you worked, you will see the result here. Assuming 12 active of 24 hours a day, time surplus is the number of hours that are left after “work hours”.

It is included specifically for those who “never have time”. Think of it as a time you have to explore new things, try new businesses, learn, or meet with those you love.

## Saving Ratio

Represents the percentage of the income you save monthly. Gives you more context.

## Burn Rate
The number of days you can live off the money saved.
